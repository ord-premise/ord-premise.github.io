The study demonstrates that substantial (bi)carbonate precipitation occurs during electrochemical COâ‚‚ reduction in Ag and Cu gas diffusion electrodes even in strongly acidic electrolytes (pH 1), correlating with a loss of selectivity for carbon products and increased hydrogen production. The [manuscript](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.4c01884) provides experimental evidence that high local pH near the catalyst can lead to these issues, suggesting that sufficiently large current densities are needed to maintain high selectivity in acidic environments.
