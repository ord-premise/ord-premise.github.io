[BattINFO Converter v1.0.0](https://battinfoconverter.streamlit.app/) is a web application that simplifies the process of ontologizing coin cell battery metadata using the BattINFO ontology. Users can easily transform their metadata into fully ontologized JSON-LD files through our intuitive Excel schemas or create custom schemas for unique cell types. This tool enhances data sharing, publication, and interoperability, with future updates planned to include expanded metadata examples for other battery cell types.
