PREMISE has completed another round of deliverables ðŸŽ‰

In WP3, the team of Corsin Battaglia has developed (1) in [D3.3](https://github.com/ord-premise/battery-domain-specific-language), a battery domain-specific language (DSL) in the [BattINFO converter](https://battinfoconverter.streamlit.app/) webapp used to automate semantic annotation of metadata using the BattINFO ontology, and (2) in [D3.4](https://github.com/ord-premise/cell-digital-twin-integration), the [Aurora Cycling Manager](https://github.com/EmpaEconversion/aurora-cycler-manager/tree/0.5.1) interface to manage the full provenance of data and metadata from manual and automated assembly and cycling experiments and deploy to the openBIS ELN.

In WP4, a collaboration between the team of Carlo Pignedoli and the openBIS team has pushed openBIS to the next level ([D4.1](https://github.com/ord-premise/openbis-for-materials-science)), introducing a flexible plugin-based [imaging technology](https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software-developer-documentation/server-side-extensions/dss-imaging.html) allowing Empa scientists to visually explore their deployed research data and metadata directly in the ELN.

Further in WP4, the PSI team has leveraged the [OO-LD specifications](https://github.com/OO-LD/schema) in developing interoperable schemas for engine- and code-agnostic common workflows in materials science, demonstrating the power of semantic meaning in facilitating cross-platform ORD exchange. The provided technical specifications ([D4.2](https://github.com/ord-premise/technical-specs-for-common-workflows)) describe the design, its benefits, technical details, and implementation of the schemas, as well as provide an [example notebook](https://github.com/edan-bainglass/common-workflow-schemas/blob/main/examples/relax.ipynb) applying the schemas to a common structure geometry optimization (relaxation) workflow.
