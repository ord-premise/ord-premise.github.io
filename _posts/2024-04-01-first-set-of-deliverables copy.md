PREMISE has completed its first set of deliverables. Metadata schemas for [battery research](https://github.com/ord-premise/metadata-batteries) and [microscopy/spectroscopy studies](https://github.com/ord-premise/metadata-spectroscopy) have been released. Guidelines for developing metadata schemas with semantic annotations tailored for interoperability was documented in a [white paper](https://github.com/ord-premise/interoperability-guidelines). Recommendation for designing user interfaces to interact with digital twins in materials science research has also been [documented](https://github.com/ord-premise/digital-twins-interface-design).
