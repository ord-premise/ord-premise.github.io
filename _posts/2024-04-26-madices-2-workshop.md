The MADICES 2 workshop was held on April 22-25 in Berlin. The audience included experts from ELN and WFMS initiatives, and ontology knowledge base developers and administrators.

After an introductory session of presentations and discussion detailing individual/shared interest, the audience split into three primary working groups, each with a dedicated set of repositories for discussion and outcome (see below).

## Organizers

- Edan Bainglass (PSI, PREMISE)
- Caterina Barillari (ETH Zurich, PREMISE)
- Matthew Evans (University of Cambridge)
- Kevin Maik Jablonka (Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena)
- Peter Kraus (Technische Universität Berlin)

## Sponsors

Along with PREMISE, MADICES 2 was supported by [CECAM](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/machine-actionable-data-interoperability-for-the-chemical-sciences-madices-2-1321), [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/), and [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/).

## Working groups

- [Semantic annotation standards and tools](https://github.com/MADICES/MADICES-2024/discussions/9)
- [Platform communication](https://github.com/MADICES/MADICES-2024/discussions/10)
- [Proprietary datasets and catalysis focus group](https://github.com/MADICES/MADICES-2024/discussions/11)

## Highlights

- The semantic annotation group developed a set of [tools and examples](https://github.com/MADICES/semantic-annotation) demonstrating the process of semantically annotating datasets towards meaningful interoperability.
- The platform communication group developed [specification drafts](https://github.com/MADICES/interop-specs) and a [demo](https://github.com/MADICES/interop-demo) for ORD interoperability between RDM platform in an agnostic manner (no _a priori_ knowledge of respective APIs) leveraging [RO-Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/).
- The proprietary datasets group worked towards understanding the challenges facing interoperability of proprietary datasets (particularly in the field of catalysis) and promoted the use of [(meta)data extractors](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors) developed by the [MaRDA](https://www.marda-alliance.org/) initiative to reduce the challenge in the short term.

Discussion and research efforts will continue on the relevant repositories mentioned above.
