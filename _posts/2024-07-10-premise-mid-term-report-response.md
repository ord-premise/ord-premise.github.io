On the 10th of July, the ORD Steering Committee of the ETH board announced the approval of the mid-term report, congratulating the PREMISE team "for what was achieved during the first phase of the project implementation", and recommending that PREMISE remains "on track with its delivery thoughout the project duration."

The PREMISE team is excited to continue delivering tools and guidelines for the seamless exchange of ORD across research platforms. We stay committed to the task of enabling the integration of experimental and simulation workflows and strongly believe its impact on scientific discovery will reverberate throughout the community.
