The MADICES 3 proposal has been submitted to CECAM. We are aiming to host it at EPFL, Switzerland, on either 20-24 or 27-31 of October 2025.

The event will be co-organized by:

- Edan Bainglass (PSI)
- Samantha Pearman-Kanza (PSDI)
- Simon Bekemeier (BAM)
- Caterina Barillari (ETHz)
- Sebastian BrÃ¼ckner (FAIRmat)

We expect a (positive ðŸ¤ž) response from CECAM in December.
