MADICES 3 has held its second pre-event virtual meeting with invited members, with a few selected members providing short talks introducing their work and how it relates to the MADICES 3 event. The meeting was a great opportunity for our members to hear about the exciting research done by our community and be exposed to some of the topics that will be discussed during the event. Discussions pertaining to the topics is already ongoing on the MADICES 3 [GitHub](https://github.com/MADICES/MADICES-2025/discussions) page.
