PREMISE has delivered an AiiDA common workflow (ACWF) for AFM simulations used in the Empa nanotech@surfaces lab ðŸŽ‰

In WP4, the PSI team developed extensions to existing AiiDA plugins to support new AiiDA common workflows for (1) post-processing of DFT results, and (2) a composite workflow leveraging 1 for AFM simulations using the [ProbeParticle](https://probe-particle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) code. The provided technical specifications and implementation details are described in [D4.3](https://github.com/ord-premise/afm-common-workflow).

The groundwork has been laid out for D1.3 (and D2.2 by extension) to deliver in the coming months a broker-mediated protocol for automated simulation submission and retrieval from and to ELNs. The work carried out at MADICES 3 yielded a [mock-up app](https://github.com/MADICES/interop-demo-human-interaction) demonstrating the [envisioned workflow](https://github.com/MADICES/MADICES-2025/discussions/27#discussioncomment-14770400). Collaboration between the PREMISE and FINALES teams will carry this forward, from mock-up to first proof-of-concept implementation.
