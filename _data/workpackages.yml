  content: "Implement the standards and guidelines of WP 1 to simulation-assisted experiments, with particular focus to the broad fields of microscopy and spectroscopy, including automation of research data publishing to open repositories"
- header: "WP 3: 2<sup>nd</sup> use-case - open data from workflow-driven robotic experiments"
  content: "Implement the standards and guidelines of WP 1 to battery research, focusing on the development of a data schema for digital twins, and develop best practices for designing and implementing autonomous robotic materials science labs"
- header: "WP 4: Reproducible and accessible materials experiments and simulations"
  content: "Design standard templates, visualizers, and modular interfaces for materials science, including common machine-actionable workflows to predict materials properties"
- header: "WP 5: Project management and outreach"
  content: "Coordinate and manage project tasks and organise outreach via follow-up MADICES conferences and online presence"
