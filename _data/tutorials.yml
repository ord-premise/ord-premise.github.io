  title: "BattINFO converter: A tool to facilitate domain-specific language (DSL) adoption"
  description: "This video demonstrates the BattINFO converter web application, which allows users to convert between the BattINFO DSL implemented in lab-level Excel documents, and the semantically annotated JSON-LD format. The BattINFO DSL is a domain-specific language for describing battery cycling experiments, while JSON-LD is a widely used format for representing linked data. The converter facilitates the adoption of the BattINFO DSL by providing an easy-to-use interface for converting between the two formats."
