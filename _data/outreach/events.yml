    The goal of the MADICES 2 workshop, sponsored and partly funded by the PREMISE project, is to build on the efforts of the 2022 MADICES workshop - to stimulate discussion among experts on ELNs, WFMSs, RDM interoperability, and ontologies; to understand the barriers to full RDM system interoperability; to propose and test solutions; and to demonstrate ORD transactions between RDM systems.
