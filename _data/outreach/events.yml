    In MADICES 3, we continued the work of the previous MADICES workshops to further advance interoperability between research data management systems. Once again, experts from ELNs, WFMSs, RDM interoperability, and ontologies came together to discuss the current state of interoperability considering metadata standards, APIs, ORD transfer protocols, use of AI/LLMs, interfacing with laboratory instruments, and research community engagement and adoption. The workshop included presentations, an expert panel, breakout sessions, a hands-on hackathon, and breaks for informal discussions and networking.

    The goal of the MADICES 2 workshop, sponsored and partly funded by the PREMISE project, is to build on the efforts of the 2022 MADICES workshop - to stimulate discussion among experts on ELNs, WFMSs, RDM interoperability, and ontologies; to understand the barriers to full RDM system interoperability; to propose and test solutions; and to demonstrate ORD transactions between RDM systems.
